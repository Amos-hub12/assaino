Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)
The term “software engineering” was officially coined during the NATO Software Engineering Conference in 19681.
This conference highlighted the need for a more structured approach to software development, moving away from the ad-hoc methods that were prevalent at the time.
 It marked the beginning of software engineering as a recognized discipline.

3. Introduction of Structured Programming (1970s)
In the 1970s, structured programming emerged as a significant advancement2.
This methodology emphasized the use of clear, logical structures in code, such as loops and conditionals, to improve readability and maintainability.
 Key figures like Edsger Dijkstra advocated for this approach, which laid the foundation for modern programming practices.

5. Advent of Agile Methodologies (2001)
The Agile Manifesto was published in 2001, introducing Agile methodologies3. Agile emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback, allowing for iterative development and continuous improvement.
 This approach has become a cornerstone of modern software development, enabling teams to adapt quickly to changing requirements and deliver high-quality software efficiently.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning & Analysis
In this phase, the project goals are defined, and the feasibility of the project is evaluated.
This involves gathering business requirements from stakeholders and analyzing them to understand what the software needs to achieve.

3. Requirements Definition
This phase involves converting the gathered information into detailed requirements.
These requirements serve as a blueprint for the development team, outlining what the software should do and the constraints it must operate within.

5. Design
During the design phase, the software’s architecture is created. This includes defining the overall system architecture, user interfaces, and data models.
The goal is to create a detailed design that guides the development process.

6. Development
In this phase, the actual coding takes place. Developers write the code based on the design specifications.
 This is often the longest phase of the SDLC, as it involves building the software’s functionality.

7. Testing
Once the software is developed, it undergoes rigorous testing to identify and fix any bugs or issues.
This ensures that the software meets the specified requirements and is free of defects.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
